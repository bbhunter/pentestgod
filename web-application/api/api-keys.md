# API Keys

> An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or calling program to an API.

### Testing API keys

#### KeyHacks

[KeyHacks](https://github.com/streaak/keyhacks) shows ways in which particular API keys found on a Bug Bounty Program can be used, to check if they are valid.

[KeyHacks.sh](https://github.com/gwen001/keyhacks.sh) is the same as KeyHacks but automated using a CLI tool.

```
./keyhacks.sh <mod> <key>
```
