# IIS

> Internet Information Services is an extensible web server software created by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family.

### Checklist

* [ ] Discover hidden paths/files using [IIS Shortname Scanner](https://github.com/irsdl/IIS-ShortName-Scanner) (if vulnerable).
* [ ] Look for usage and vulnerabilities of Telerik UI (not just in the root folder!).&#x20;
* [ ] Check for known MachineKeys using [blacklist3r](https://github.com/NotSoSecure/Blacklist3r).&#x20;
* [ ] Heavy focus on file read vulnerabilities and look for web.config (machineKey = RCE).&#x20;
* [ ] Try uploading a Web.config on file uploads (RCE).&#x20;
* [ ] Look for verbose "padding" errors. Might lead to Padding Oracle Attack.

### Leaking the web.config

If we can leak the web.config file for a .NET application you are testing (via [LFD](../vulnerabilities/directory-traversal.md), [XXE](../vulnerabilities/xxe.md), etc), we can most likely achieve remote code execution by exploiting the VIEWSTATE parameter.

### Leveraging ViewState

* [ ] Look for MAC validation on Burpsuite using [ViewState Editor](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/ba17d9fb487448b48368c22cb70048dc).&#x20;
* [ ] Heavy focus on file read vulns (MachineKey = RCE).&#x20;
* [ ] Try guessing the MachineKey using [Blacklist3r](https://github.com/NotSoSecure/Blacklist3r/).&#x20;
* [ ] Look for file uploads (web.config = RCE).
