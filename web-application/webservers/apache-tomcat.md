# Apache Tomcat

> Apache Tomcat is a popular open source web server and Servlet container for Java code.

### Checklist

* [ ] Try to access "/auth.jsp". Might disclose some passwords in a backtrace.
* [ ] Try accessing /manager/html with [default credentials.](../../misc/default-passwords/apache-tomcat.md)
* [ ] Try path traversal (when deployed with nginx, explained [below](apache-tomcat.md#path-traversal-nginx-+-tomcat) ).

### Path traversal (nginx + tomcat)

When Apache Tomcat is in combination with nginx, we can perform a "path traversal" since nginx will not normalize the path and tomcat will rely on nginx validation. Learn more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28xWcRegncw).
