> Server-side request forgery is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to **induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain** of the attacker's choosing.

### Enumerate local services

If we can read internal files, try reading "/proc/net/tcp" or "/proc/net/tcp6". This gives us a list of all listening TCP sockets. A typical entry of /proc/net/tcp would look like this:

!["/proc/net/tcp" example.](../../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

The first four columns represent the following information. You can read more [here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/proc\_net\_tcp.txt).

!["/proc/net/tcp" column description.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

To retrieve the decimal value of the port number, just convert it from HEX. To extract the local IP, we can use the following python3 script:

```
import socket 
import struct 
hex_ip = input("Enter IP (in hex): ") 
addr_long = int(hex_ip, 16) 
print("IP in dotted-decimal notation:", socket.inet_ntoa(struct.pack("<L", addr_long)))
```
