# JWT

### Type of attacks

* [ ] Use alg "none", "None", "NoNe" and remove the signature.
* [ ] Check the expiration of the JWT (may be too high?)
* [ ] Maybe no signature verification. Try changing the data
* [ ] Brute-force the key (when symmetric)
* [ ] Try injections like sql $'{"login":"admin \\' or \\'a'=\\'a"}'&#x20;
