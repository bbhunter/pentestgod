# Wordpress

> WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database.

### Interesting sensitive files

The following endpoints might leak some juicy information:

```bash
/wp-config.php.bak #Might leak some info including DB creds
/wp-content/debug.log #PHP related debug data
```

### Username enumeration

The following endpoint might leak to username disclosure/enumeration:

```
/wp-json/wp/v2/users
/?rest_route=/wp/v2/users
```
