# Static Analysis

### Download APK

Use "adb" to download the APK to our PC. Other tools such as dex2jar/jd\_gui or mara/mobsf works as well.

```bash
#Install Wi-Fi ADB on the phone and on the PC. Then run from our PC:
adb connect ip:port #connect to mobile adb
adb devices #list devices
adb shell #open a shell
adb pull "/data/app/com...../base.apk" . #Download APK to current folder
unzip Appbase.apk #Extract APK files
```

### Converting APK into JAR

[dex2jar](https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar) enables converting an APK file into a JAR one so that the applicationâ€™s code can be viewed. Then you can open it in a GUI using [jd-gui](https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui).

```bash
sh d2j-dex2jar.sh -f ~/path/to/apk_to_decompile.apk -o /path/to/output
#The output file will be apk_to_decompile-dex2jar.jar

$ jd-gui #Then file > open > apk_to_decompile-dex2jar.jar
```

### App permissions

Every app project have an AndroidManifest.xml file at the root of the project source set. The manifest file describes essential information about the app to the Android build tools, the Android operating system, and Google Play.&#x20;

Review the permissions that the app needs in order to access protected parts of the system or other apps. It also declares any permissions that other apps must have if they want to access content from this app.

### Search for juicy info

Search for secrets, URLs, IPs, endpoints, PII...

```bash
#APK files:
grep -ira "http" ./*
grep -ira "token" ./*
grep -ira "password" ./*
grep -ira "string" ./*
grep -ira "hash" ./*
grep -ira "access" ./*
grep -ira "user" ./*
grep -ira "admin" ./*
grep -ira "root" ./*
.
.
#Other files/directories that might contain secrets:
/data/data/<app>
/storage/emulated/0
/mnt/extSdCard
/mnt/external_sd
```

### MobSF

[Mobile Security Framework (MobSF)](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF) is an automated, all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis.

```bash
#Launch using docker
docker run -p8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf
#Go to localhost:8000 and upload the APK
#Run static analysis checks and analyze the results
```
