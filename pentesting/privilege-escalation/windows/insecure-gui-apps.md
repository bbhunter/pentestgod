# Insecure GUI Apps

If we have access to an application which is running with administrator privileges we can try to spawn a command prompt.

**Example:**

1. Inside the application use the button "File > Open"
2. In the nav var, put:

```
file://c:/windows/system32/cmd.exe
```

If the GUI is insecure we will obtain a command prompt running as the context of a privileged user.
