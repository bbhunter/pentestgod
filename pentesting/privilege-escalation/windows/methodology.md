# Methodology

### Checklist

1. Check your user (whoami) and groups (net user $user).
2. Run [WinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS) with "fast", "searchfast" and "cmd" options.
3. Run [SeatBelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt) and other enumeration scripts.
4. Spend time reading outputs.
5. Create checklist from the outputs.
6. Quick look at files (home dir, C:\\, C:\Program Files.., D:\\...)
7. Read interesting files since they might contain sensitive information.
8. Try things that do not have many steps first: registry exploits, services..
9. Look at admin processes, enumerate versions and find exploits.
10. Check for internal ports (can forward if necessary).
