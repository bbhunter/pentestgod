# Methodology

### Checklist



1. Check your user (whoami, id...)
2. Run smart enumeration with increasing levels.
3. Run linenum or other scripts.
4. Manual enumeration (g0tmi1k blog or smth).
5. Try fast privesc first (sudo, suid and crons).
6. Spend time reading the results of the outputs.
7. Make notes of findings in LSE.sh
8. Avoid rabbit holes by creating a checklist.
9. Quick look at common files (in our home directory) and not that common (/var/backup, /var/logs...).
10. Look at processes, enumerate versions and search exploits.
11. Check for internal ports (can forward them).
