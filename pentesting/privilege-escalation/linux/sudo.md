# SUDO

Check THE sudo version and look for vulnerabilities:

```
sudo --version
```

Check the list of programs the current user can run as sudo:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
sudo -l
#If env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD is set at the beginning of the output we can escalate to root.
#If env_keep+=LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set at the beginning of the output we can escalate to root. 
```
{% endcode %}

If we are restricted to running certain programs as sudo, it's possible to escape to root. Check the following link:
