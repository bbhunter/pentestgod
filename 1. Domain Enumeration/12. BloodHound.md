BloodHoud have two parts:

**1. Ingestors:** Collects data for BloodHound.
**2. GUI:** Where we can upload the data collected.

### Part 1: Collecting data

```bash
cd C:\AD\Tools\BloodHound-master\Ingestors #Move to ingestors path

. .\SharpHound.ps1 #Load the functions

Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All -Verbose #Run all collection methods
```
