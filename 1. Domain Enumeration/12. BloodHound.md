# BloodHound

> Provides the capability of mapping shortest path for interesting thigns like Domain Admins.

> It is very noise, do not use it on a red team engagement.

BloodHoud have two parts:

**1. Ingestors:** Collects data for BloodHound.

**2. GUI:** Where we can upload the data collected.

### Collecting data

```bash
cd C:\AD\Tools\BloodHound-master\Ingestors #Move to ingestors path

. .\SharpHound.ps1 #Load the script in-memory

Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All -Verbose #Run all collection methods, will generate a zip

Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All -ExcludeDC -Verbose #This one will avoid detections from Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA)
```

### Setting up BloodHound

```bash
cd C:\AD\Tools\BloodHound-win32-x64\BloodHound.exe #Execute the binary

#Open a cmd and configure neo4j
cd C:\AD\Tools\neo4j-community-3.5.1\bin

#Install service and start it
neo4j.bat install service
neo4j.bat start

#Now go back to BloodHound and change default password.
```

### Uploading data

Upload the .zip file generated from ingestors.

**Note:** Sometimes BloodHoud misses the "sessions" part. Manually collect it and upload again:

```bash
Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod LoggedOn -Verbose
```

### Queries

There are some pre-built queries, but we can create custom ones. Some pre-built are:

- Find all Domain Admins.
- Shortes path to Domain Admins.
- Map Domain trusts.
- ..

Also we can mark users as "owned" to help BloodHound find new paths.

### Paths

We can generate a map from an object-object (for example: studentXX to XXX-Machine) and BloodHound will find the shortest path.
