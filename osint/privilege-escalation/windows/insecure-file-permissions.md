# Insecure File Permissions

### Manual check

Does any path that executes a Windows Service (as a privileged user) have full RW permissions for Everyone? This could lead a low-privileged user to replace the executable used by this service and put a malicious one.

**Step 1:** List running services:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
Get-WmiObject win32_service | Select-Object Name, State, PathName | Where-Object {$_.State -like 'Running'}
```
{% endcode %}

Interesting services are the ones that are not inside the common "system32" directory.

**Step 2:** Enumerate permissions on the target service using "icacls" Windows Utility:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
#BINARY_PATH is the absolute path of the .exe file, including the /filename.exe
icacls "$BINARY_PATH"
```
{% endcode %}

If the permissions are, for example, full access to "BUILTIN\Users" group, that means that any user can read and write it. "icalc" permissions:

| Mask | Permissions    |
| ---- | -------------- |
| F    | Full           |
| M    | Modify         |
| RX   | Read and Write |
| R    | Read-only      |
| W    | Write-Only     |

**Step 3:** Change the binary (.exe) from the service with a malicious one. Restart the service (if we have enough privileges), restart the system or wait for someone to reboot it.

We can check if the service will start automatically after a reboot with the following command:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
wmic service where caption="$SERVICENAME" get name, caption, state, start mode
#If output is "Auto" means that the service will start automatically after a reboot.
```
{% endcode %}

If it's set to Auto, reebot:

```powershell
reboot /r /t 0 
#/r for reboot 
#/t for wait in seconds
```

### AccessEnum

There's no built-in way to quickly view user accesses to a tree of directories or keys. [AccessEnum](https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/sysinternals/downloads/accesschk) gives you a full view of your file system and Registry security settings in seconds, making it the ideal tool for helping you find security holes and lock down permissions where necessary.

### AccessChk

Windows administrators often need to know what kind of accesses specific users or groups have to resources including files, directories, Registry keys, global objects and Windows services. [AccessChk](https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/sysinternals/downloads/accesschk) quickly answers these questions with an intuitive interface and output.
