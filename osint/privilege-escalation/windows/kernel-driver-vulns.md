# Kernel/Driver Vulns

Can we find a vulnerability on any driver that matches our OS version & architecture?

**Step1:** Determine the version and architecture of the target operating system.

```powershell
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version" /C:"System Type"
```

**Step 2:** Locate a native kernel vulnerability for the OS Version & architecture found before and try to use it to elevate our privileges.

```powershell
driverquery /v #Interesting ones are non typical microsoft drivers.
```

**Step 3:** Find the version of the installed driver, search an exploit that matches this version, compile it and execute it.
