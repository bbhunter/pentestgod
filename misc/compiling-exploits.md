# Compiling Exploits

### cross-compiler

We can compile an exploit that requires Windows dependencies from a Linux box. It is very useful when lack tools on a Windows machine and we need to compile an exploit (it's always better to do it on it's own platform, but we can try). In this case, we can use a cross-compiler to help in the way:

<pre class="language-bash" data-overflow="wrap"><code class="lang-bash">#Install:
apt install mingw-w64

#Usage:
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc $EXPLOITFILENAME.c -o $OUTPUTNAME.exe
<strong>
</strong><strong>#In case of error, try adding the flag: -lws2_32:
</strong>i686-w64-mingw32-gcc $EXPLOITFILENAME.c -o $OUTPUTNAME.exe -lws2_32</code></pre>

### Python standalone executable

Python code requires an interpreter in order to execute it's instructions. This means we need python to be installed in a machine that we want to run a python script. [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. The user can run the packaged app without installing a Python interpreter or any modules.

```bash
#Install:
pip install -U pyinstaller

#Usage:
pyinstaller your_program.py
```
