# Kerberos

> Kerberos is the defacto authentication mechanism on AD environments.
  
### How it works

Suppose we want to access an application server from a domain joined client machine. This is what happends:

1. Client sends a timestamp encrypted with the NTLM hash of the user **(AS-REQ)**.
2. KDC responds with a TGT encrypted with the NTLM hash of the krbtgt user **(AS-REP)**.
3. Client sends the TGT back to to the KDC and requests a TGS for a service **(TGS-REQ)**.
4. KDC responds with a TGS encrypted using the service NTLM hash **(TGS-REP)**.
5. Client connects to the app server and presents the TGS to the service **(AP-REQ)**.
6. Optional mutual authentication **(AP-REP)**.

**Note:** Almost every step is abusable!
