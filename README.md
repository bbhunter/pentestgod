# Pentestgod

Hello everyone!

This gitbook is a collection of everything I learn while working as a pentester, doing bug bounty hunting or playing CTFs. It started as a self-note private project but decided to make it public in case anyone needs. Hope you find it useful!

**Note:** Please feel free to open a PR on github if you find any mistake (typo included since english is not my primary language), any missing reference or if you want to include anything. Much appreciated!

## **Happy Hacking!**
