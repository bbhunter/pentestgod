# Local Privilege Escalation

Until now we have tried:

1. Hunting for local admin access on other machines (Get-WMILocal...)
2. Hunting for high privilege domain accounts (Invoke-UserHunter...)

Now we are going to look for local privesc. There are multiple ways to escalate on a Windows box:

* Missing patches.
* Automated deployment and autologon passwords (unattend.xml, sysprep.xml...).
* AlwaysInstallElevated.
* Missconfigured Services.
* DLL Hijacking (hijack a dll of a services is looking for).

### Tools

* **PowerUp:** Invoke-AllChecks
* **BeRoot:** .\beRoot.exe
* **Privesc:** Invoke-PrivEsc

### Services Issues using PowerUp

#### Get services with unquoted paths and a space

```bash
Get-ServiceUnquoted -Verbose

#List all services on current machine and its binpath
Get-WmiObject -Class win32_service | select pathname
```

#### Get services where the current user can write to its binary path or change arguments to the binary

TLDR: Modify the binary.

```bash
Get-ModifiableServiceFile -Verbose
```

#### Get the service whose configuration current user can modify

TLDR: Pointing the executable to another location, insted of overwriting it.

```bash
Get-ModifiableService -Verbose
```

#### All Checks

```bash
Invoke-AllChecks
```

### Enterprise Applications

* One of the easy ways to escalate is target enterprise apps which are usually developed without security in mind.
* High changes that these apps are running as system or local admin.
* Examples: CI Tools can have the capability to run OS commands.

#### Jenkins

1. Bruteforce
2. Passwords like username:username or username:reverseusername
3. Maybe no auth
4. /script <- console
5. Configure builds can lead to OS execution on the master node (not the slaves)

### Reminder!

PowerUp have some "auto-exploitation" for some misconfigurations. If that leads to creating a new local administrator, it is better to add our current domain user to the administrators group (so we do not lose the AD context).
