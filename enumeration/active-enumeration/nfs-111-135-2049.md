# NFS (111,135,2049)

> Network File System (NFS): Network File System allows remote hosts to mount the systems/directories over a network. It runs on both TCP and UDP on port 111 and 2049.

### Banner grabbing

```bash
nc -nv 10.11.1.72 111
```

## Linux

### Showmount:

Show mountable directories:

```bash
showmount -e $HOST
```

#### Find services that may have registered with rpcbind:

```bash
nmap -sV -p111 --script=rpcinfo $IPADDRESS
```

#### Nmap NFS NSE Scripts:

```bash
#Path:
ls -la /usr/share/nmap/scripts/nfs*
#Run them all:
nmap -p 111 --script nfs* $IPADDRESS
```

## Windows

```bash
nmap -n -v -sV -Pn -p 135 --script=msrpc-enum $IPADDRESS
```

### Mount paths

#### Mounting discovered paths:

```bash
sudo mount $IPADDRESS:/$REMOTE_PATH /$LOCAL_PATH
#If any error, try using he flag "-o nolock"
#to disable file locking, which is often needed for older NFS servers:
mount -o nolock $IPADDRESS:/$REMOTE_PATH /$LOCAL_PATH
```
